1) I will add Tony’s attachment stuff to the main bug report
2) we need a search page that meets the criteria in the slides, I can also work on that
3) we need to export bug reports to xml, ascii, or JSON (json would probably be easiest)
4) Victor, you need to finish the functional area add/edit and program add/edit
